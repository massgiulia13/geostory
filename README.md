## Abstract
Geostory is a geospatial analysis of art historian’s birthplace/country of citizenship in relation to the period they studied among different institutions from a distributional point of view. The aim is to find out which factors influence the most art historians in the choice of the artistic period to study. 

### Research questions
- What is the citizenship of each art historian and how many historians came from each country?
- Which are the most studied artistic periods by those historians?
- What are the institutes present in Artchives? In which country and city are they located?
- What is the most studied artistic period per number of collections kept in each institute? 
- Is there a relation between the country of birth or citizenship of the art historians and the artistic period they decided to study? 
- Is there a relation between the country of birth of the art historian and the institute where they decided to work?
